            🎯 Objective:
            Perform automated quality diagnostics on batch measurement data (humidity, density, thickness)

            🧩 Scope of Work:
            1. Load and interpret input data (CSV or table format).
            2. Compare each parameter against nominal tolerance ranges.
            3. Identify deviations, quantify them, and interpret their technical significance.
            4. Correlate deviations with potential process anomalies (if available).
            5. Summarize batch compliance status and provide clear engineering insights.

            🧠 Technical Guidelines:
            - Express all numerical deviations using engineering units.
            - Include the likely physical cause (e.g., “sensor drift”, “material compression”).
            - Use concise, factual sentences. Avoid generic expressions.
            - If all batches comply with standards, explicitly state “No non-conformity detected.”
            - When multiple parameters deviate, prioritize by severity and potential impact.

            🧠 Technical Guidelines:

                to 'co2_kg' when writing the report.
            - Use standardized units (kWh, kg, kg CO₂e). Be concise and factual.
